CC  Menaquinone may be synthesized by one of two independent pathways. The
CC  better known pathway, which includes MenA, MenB, etc., as found in
CC  Escherichia coli, passes through the intermediate SEPHCHC (see
CC  GenProp0058). An alternate pathway, found in both Helicobacter pylori
CC  and Streptomyces coelicolor, involves the intermediate futalosine (see
CC  GenProp0829). This property evaluates to YES is either menaquinone
CC  biosynthesis pathway is complete.
