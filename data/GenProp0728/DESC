RT  Archaeal type III RuBisCOs function in a pathway for AMP metabolism.
RA  Sato T, Atomi H, Imanaka T;
RL  Science. 2007;315:1003-1006.
CC  Lee, et al. (PMID:17303759) have described an archaeal pathway for the
CC  conversion of AMP to 3-phosphoglycerate with the release of adenine.
CC  This pathway includes an AMP phosphorylase previously annotated as a
CC  probable thymidine phosphorylase, and a ribose-1,5-bisphosphate
CC  isomerase previously annotated as a translation initation factor.
**  A common feature of these genomes is said to be having an ADP-dependent
**  sugar kinase.  See PF04587 ADP_PFK_GK ADP-specific
**  Phosphofructokinase/Glucokinase conserved region
