CC  The RAG complex is a component of the the TORC1 sensor pathway  
CC  which promotes protein synthesis in the presence of adequate
CC  energy and amino acids.  The heterodimeric Rag complex 
CC  alternates between an active ATP-bound form and an inactive GDP-
CC  bound form [1].  When active, the Rag complex relocalizes the 
CC  mTORC1 complex to the lysosome membrane surface, where it is 
CC  activated by the GTPase Rheb [2].  Activity of the RAG complex is 
CC  controlled by the GATOR1 and GATOR2 complexes.
**  Complex consists of either RagA or RagB and either RagC or RagD.
**  All four Rag proteins are in the same InterPro entry.
