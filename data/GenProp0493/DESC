CC  The recBCD pathway, important in double stranded break DNA repair by
CC  homologous recombination, is replaced by AddAB in several bacterial
CC  lineages. The AddAB gene pairs are quite distant, in terms of sequence
CC  similarity, between that of Gram-positive bacteria and that of
CC  alphaproteobacteria. Note that an alternative, less common method of
CC  repair of double stranded breaks is nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ),
CC  and that pathway may coexist with AddAB in a genome. In some species,
CC  AddAB is called RexAB.
**  Probably should always be a gene pair.
