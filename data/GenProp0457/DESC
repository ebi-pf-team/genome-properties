DC  rhamnose catabolism
DR  KEGG; map00051;
CC  L-rhamnose, (aka 6-deoxy-L-mannose) is a common sugar synthesized and
CC  utilized in oligosaccharides and glcyolipids by many bacteria [2]. The
CC  monosaccharide is available in various environments and thus
CC  regulatory, transport and enzymatic systems have also evolved for its
CC  breakdown and use as a carbon source. The system modeled here includes
CC  specific transporters, ketose-aldose isomerases, kinases, and aldolases
CC  which result in the production of lactaldehyde and glycerone-phosphate.
CC  As these genes are generally organized into operons, assignments can be
CC  made for regulatory components as well as transport and enzymatic
CC  components which, by homology alone, cannot be assigned a specific
CC  substrate. Certain of the enzymes in this system are similar enough to
CC  cognate enzymes in the fucose catabolism system (GenProp0458) as to
CC  have caused gene naming errors in the past (i.e.
CC  fuculokinase/rhamnokinase). The system in certain rhizobial species [1]
CC  has been reported to vary from the canonical pathway in that the sugar
CC  may be phosphorylated prior to isomerization (i.e. the rhamnulokinase
CC  may in fact be a rhamnokinase and the rhamnose isomerase may be a
CC  rhamnose-1-phosphate isomerase), although this has not yet been
CC  independantly verified. In addition to the characterized
CC  rhamnose:proton symporter [3], rhamnose catabolism operons contain
CC  transporters from the ABC, and major facilitator families. Regulators
CC  are generally members of the DeoR and AraC [4] families. The product of
CC  both rhamnose and fucose catabolism is lactaldehyde, and subsequently
CC  alcohol and aldehyde dehydrogenases are often present in those operons
CC  to convert it to either 1,2-propane diol or lactate depending on
CC  oxidation conditions [5]. Rhamnose operons also often contain an
CC  epimerase (mutarotase) enzyme which has been proposed to be essential
CC  unly under limiting L-rhamnose conditions [6].  Partial rhamnose
CC  catabolism operons have been detected in Thermotoga species which
CC  appear to handle the import and cleavage of rhamnose-containing
CC  oligosaccharides.
