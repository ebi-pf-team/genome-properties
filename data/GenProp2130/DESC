CC  The production of biogas (methane) involves the anaerobic digestion and
CC  co-digestion process of food waste. These waste is composed by different
CC  types of biomolecules, such as lipids, proteins and carbohydrates. Each
CC  kind of biomolecule is hydrolysed in several ways to obtain small molecules
CC  as fatty acids, amino acids and glucose. Thes are then transformed in
CC  volatile fatty acids (VFA). The VFA can be converted in acetate, which is
CC  the main compound used by archaeas to produce methane.
**  The PWY-5768 pathway was found only in fungi.
