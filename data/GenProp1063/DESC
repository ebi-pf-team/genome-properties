CC  This broadly distributed and fairly common microbial three protein
CC  family system contains a radical SAM enzyme of unknown specificity, a
CC  branch of the AMMECR1 family, and a branch of the Memo (mediator of
CC  ErbB2-driven cell motility) family. The Memo-like component and
CC  AMMECR1-like component may be fused, or encoded by tandem genes if not
CC  fused, but this three-gene property has its genes encoded far from each
CC  other more often than is typical for most Genome Properties.
