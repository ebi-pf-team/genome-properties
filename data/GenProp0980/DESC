DE  Protein sorting system, putative, exosortase F class
TP  SYSTEM
AU  Haft DH
TH  0
CC  This system occurs in the lineage Bacteriodetes, and contains a homolog
CC  to exosortase (EpsH). Like archaeal homologs, it is shorter by about 70
CC  amino acids towards the N-terminus, and it lacks an EpsI-like domain.
CC  Species with this system lack a classical PEP-CTERM, PEF-CTERM, or
CC  PGF-CTERM-like protein sorting C-terminal domain.
**  Probably should add more from neighborhood.
