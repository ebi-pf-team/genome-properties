DC  L-leucine degradation I
DR  MetaCyc; LEU-DEG2-PWY;
CC  The catabolism of L-leucine begins with its transamination to
CC  4-methyl-2-oxopentanoate, followed by oxidative decarboxylation to
CC  isovaleryl-CoA. isovaleryl-CoA then undergoes a four-step process,
CC  involving dehydrogenation to 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA, carboxylation to
CC  3-methylglutaconyl-CoA, hydration to (S)-3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA,
CC  and finally a thioester hydrolysis forming acetyl-CoA and acetoacetate [1].
CC  Leucine degradation is different from the degradation of the other
CC  branched-chain amino acids, in that it includes a carboxylation step. The
CC  CO2 fixing enzyme, methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase, requires a biotin
CC  cofactor.
