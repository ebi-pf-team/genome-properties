CC  The flagellar rotor complex consists of the FliG, FliM and FliN
CC  proteins.  This complex is also known as the flagellar motor switch,
CC  due to its role in determining the clockwise or counter-clockwise
CC  rotation of the flagellum.  The complex is located at the inner end of
CC  the basal body.  The FliG protein interacts with the stator complex
CC  protein MotA.  The FliM protein interacts with phosphorylated CheY from
CC  the chemotaxis response regulation system allowing the transduction of
CC  the directional switching signal.  The subunits of this structure are
CC  predicted to be in a 26:34:100 (FliG:FliM:FliN) ratio per motor
CC  complex.
