CC  The E. coli O113 antigen monomer [1] consists of a branched
CC  pentasaccharide of relatively simple galactose and glucose-derived
CC  units:
CC  [->4)aDGalNAc{(3<-1)bDGal}(1->4)aDGalA(1->3)aDGal(1->3)bDGlcNAc(1->].
CC  Additionally, there is some degree of O-acetylation, the position and
CC  extent of which has not yet been determined. The biosynthesis cluster
CC  contains four corresponding glycosyltransferases, WbnABDE. Assignments
CC  of activity have been predicted at ECODAB, but are not as strong as
CC  some and may be in error. These are based on the following homology
CC  data and logic: Of the four, WbnE has the strongest similarity to other
CC  known enzymes, in the range 37-46% identity, the top four of which are
CC  all predicted to carry out the aDGal(1->3)bDGlcNAc reaction. WbnA has
CC  the next strongest similarities, in the range 33-37% identity, and
CC  although the reactions predicted to be carried out by these homologs
CC  are similar to both the aDGalNAc(1->4)aDGalA and the
CC  aDGalNAc{(3<-1)bDGal} reactions, one homolog carries out precisely the
CC  former reaction and has been experimentally confirmed. Of the remaining
CC  two transferases, WbnB and WbnD, both of which show similarities to
CC  other glycosyltransferases only in the 26-29% identity range, the
CC  correlation between the homologs activities and the ones needed in the
CC  O113 cluster are weak and ambiguous. So although ECODAB makes
CC  predictions, we do not regard them as sufficiently strong to drive
CC  transitive annotations.
