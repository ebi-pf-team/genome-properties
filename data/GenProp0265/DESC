CC  Trehalose is compatible solute, an osmolyte that protects cells against
CC  osmotic stress. It is built from two glucose molecules in an
CC  alpha,alpha linkage and can be made by at least three different
CC  pathways. In the OtsAB pathway (ots stands for osmotically regulated
CC  trehalose synthesis), OtsA (EC 2.4.1.15) makes trehalose-6-phosphate
CC  from UDP-glucose and D-glucose 6-phosphate. OtsB (EC 3.1.3.12) removes
CC  the phosphate. 
**  UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, GalU, TIGR01099, was a part of this
**  family but turns out to give little info: not clustered, present in
**  more than half the negatives, and often >= 2 per genome.
