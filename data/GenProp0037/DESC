CC  The essential amino acid tryptophan is synthesized in prokaryotes,
CC  plants, and fungi via a conserved six step pathway from the branchpoint
CC  compound chrosimate, a common precursor in the biosynthesis of aromatic
CC  amino acids [1]. Seven catalytic domains and two alpha/beta subunit
CC  complexes comprise this pathway. Individually expressed in some
CC  organisms, gene fusions encoding single proteins possessing two or more
CC  of these catalytic domains have been observed for every trp gene.
CC  Although the occurance of gene fusions have been shown to be
CC  phylogenetically unrelated, a conserved gene order can be discerned
CC  within the domain Bacteria. Occasionally gene(s) dissociations disrupt
CC  gene order as in Campylobacter jejuni and Deinococcus radiodurans, or
CC  the pathway is found split between two separate chromosomes as in
CC  Rhodobacter sphaeroides. In cyanobacteria, such as Nostoc and Anabaena,
CC  it is not uncommon to observe paralogous trp genes as part of a larger
CC  "supraoperon" including other aromatic amino acid synthesizing genes as
CC  well as their trp counterparts [2].
**  Step 1A, anthranilate synthase component I is tricky because of
**  similarity to PABA synthase component I.  ECNUM evidence cannot be used
**  because the ECNUM for step 1A is identical to the ECNUM for step 1B
**  {grrrr}.
