CC  The seven genes that form the core of this apparently laterally
CC  transferred cassette include four genes homologous to the NeuABCD genes
CC  producing acetyl-modified CMP-neuraminic (sialic) acids. This
CC  nine-carbon sugar is formed from the condensation of UMP-GlcNAc and
CC  phosphoenolpyruvate. In addition to these genes are an
CC  epimerase/dehydratase gene distantly similar to 4,6-dehydratases and a
CC  aminotransferase distantly similar to perosamine synthetase.  It is
CC  reasonable to propose that these two genes act on UDP-GlcNAc or a
CC  similar sugar to remove the 6-hydroxyl group and replace the 4-hydroxyl
CC  group with an amino group, possibly changing the chirality of one or
CC  both of those centers in the process.  The purpose of the final
CC  additional gene in the cassette, a nucleotidyltransferase is unclear,
CC  although the production of a bis-nucleotidylsugar, or alternatively,
CC  two different nucleotidylsugars are possibilities.  In many organisms
CC  additional genes are observed intercalated with these seven, suggesting
CC  additional modifications to the product such as methyl- and
CC  formyl-transferases, redox enzymes, etc.
