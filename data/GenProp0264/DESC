CC  Glucosylglycerol is an osmolyte, a solute compatible with biological
CC  function inside cells that serves as an osmoprotectant. Other osmolytes
CC  include trehalose, sucrose, and glycine betaine and other betaines.
CC  Betaines offer stronger osmoprotection than glucosylglycerol but are
CC  nitrogen-requiring. The key enzyme, glucosylglycerol-phosphate
CC  synthase, uses ADP-glucose + sn-glycerol 3-phosphate.
CC  Glucose-1-phosphate adenylyltransferase, which synthesizes ADP-glucose,
CC  is therefore included in this property although it also has other
CC  roles, such as in glycogen biosynthesis. 
**  The transporter that recovers leaked glucosylglycerol might
**  legitimately be part, making this system, but the ggsA gene looks like
**  part of a multi-specificity sugar transporter group, has no specific
**  HMM. TIGR02091 2.7.7.27 TIGR02399 3.1.3.69 stpA TIGR02398 2.4.1.213
**  ggpS.  Note: I disbelieved ntxc01 member until I found a 
**  Stenotrophomonas sequence in NCBI, running ahead of NIAA, very close in
**  sequence. DHH.
