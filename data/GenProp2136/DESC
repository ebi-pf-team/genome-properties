CC  ActP is a member of the Solute:Sodium Symporter family and is cotranscribed
CC  with its neighbor, acs, encoding acetyl coenzyme A synthetase, which is
CC  involved in the scavenging acetate [1]. The specificity of ActP is rather
CC  narrow, a common feature of most bacterial carboxylate permeases, being
CC  highly specific for short-chain aliphatic monocarboxylates.
