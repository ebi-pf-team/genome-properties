CC  Fibrinogen is the precursor of fibrin.  During hemostasis, thrombin  
CC  activates fibrin which then cross-links to form an insoluble matrix.
CC  Three subunits, alpha, beta and gamma, form fibrinogen[1].  Thrombin
CC  releases fibrinopeptides A and B from the N-termini of the alpha and
CC  beta chains respectively.  Factor XIII is an transglutaminase which 
CC  catalyses formation of isopeptide bonds between subunits via the  
CC  newly exposed N-termini.
**  SwissProt calls all peptides released by thrombin fibrinopeptide A,
**  which is incorrect.  NDR.
**  The role of the gamma subunit is unclear.  This is not known to be a 
**  source of a fibrinopeptide.  NDR.
