RT  Recycling of the anhydro-N-acetylmuramic acid derived from cell wall
RT  murein involves a two-step conversion to N-acetylglucosamine-phosphate.

RT  MurQ Etherase is required by Escherichia coli in order to metabolize
RT  anhydro-N-acetylmuramic acid obtained either from the environment or
RT  from its own cell wall.

CC  Components of the bacterial murein cell wall, including
CC  1,6-anhydro-N-acetylmuramic acid (anhMurNAc), N-acetyl-D-glucosamine
CC  (GlcNAc), D-alanine, and murein tripeptide are released during in
CC  murein recycling as bacteria grow. Pathways exist to recycle these
CC  components for the biosynthesis of new cell wall. This pathway
CC  describes a two-enzyme pathway for converting anhMurNAc into
CC  N-acetylglucosamine-phosphate.
**  Oddly, in far to many genomes it is one enzyme or the other, but a
**  failure to have both. I explored this by PPP, but unsuccessfully.
