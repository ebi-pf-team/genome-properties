CC  Beta-glutamate is an osmolyte produced in one step from glutamate by
CC  the action of glutamate 2,3-aminomutase. The eam gene, encoding
CC  glutamate 2,3-aminomutase, is often preceded by a ydaO (yuaA) family
CC  riboswitch, which appears to bind a metabolite that indicates cellular
CC  stress.
