CC  This set of genes includes those which are found in every archaeal
CC  genome but may be present in multiple copies generally or in greater
CC  than 5% of genomes.  An evaluation of 32 publicly available bacterial
CC  genomes found greater than 95% having at least one copy of each of
CC  these genes.
