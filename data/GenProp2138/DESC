CC  The methylaspartate pathway is one of the major pathways by which glutamate
CC  is fermented and has been first described in a closely related group of
CC  soil Clostridia. It includes two documented varieties - one in which
CC  L-glutamate is degraded to butanoate ( L-glutamate degradation VII (to
CC  butanoate)) and one in which L-glutamate is degraded into propanoate
CC  ( L-glutamate degradation VIII (to propanoate)).
