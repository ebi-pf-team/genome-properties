CC  The NuA4 histone acetyltransferase complex is involved 
CC  in epigenetic transcriptional activation of selected  
CC  genes by acetylation of nucleosomal histone H4 and H2A. 
CC  The NuA4 complex is also involved in DNA repair [1,2].  
CC  The complex in yeast is composed of at least 
CC  ACT1, ARP4, YAF9, VID21, SWC4, EAF3, EAF5, EAF6, 
CC  EAF7, EPL1, ESA1, TRA1 and YNG2 [1].  
**  Evidence for step 2 is a child of evidence for step 1.
**  Evidence for step 4 does not include protein from 
**  Saccharomyces cerevisiae, for which there is no good model.
**  PTHR10880:SF15 is more specific for EAF3, but both 
**  underhits and overhits.
**  Evidence for step 1 is also used in GP2075, GP2076, GP2077 and GP2080.
**  Evidence for step 2 is also used in GP2076.
**  Evidence for step 3 is also used in GP2075.
**  Evidence for step 4 is also used in GP2075.
**  Evidence for step 11 is also used in GP2075.
**  Evidence for step 12 is also used in GP2053, GP2057, GP2058 and GP2075.
**  Threshold is therefore set to 5.
