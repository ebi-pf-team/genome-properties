CC  Thaumarchaeosortase (archaeosortase G, ArtG) is a member of the
CC  exosortase/archaeosortase family of putative protein-processing
CC  enzymes. It is restricted to the Thaumarchaeota, a branch of the
CC  Archaea. Species with ArtG each have roughly ten sequences with a
CC  C-terminal putative protein-sorting domain, PEFG-CTERM. This system is
CC  unusual in that the Cys conserved in all other subfamilies described in
CC  the exosortase/archaeosortase family, and thought to be part of the
CC  active site, is replaced by Ser in ArtG.
