CC  3-methylarginine can be a natural product in its own right, or a
CC  precursor of another natural product, such as arginomycin. The
CC  aminotransferase catalyzes the first and third steps of the pathway,
CC  removing the alpha-amino group from arginine, later replacing it on the
CC  beta-methylated form. The second step is catalyzed by a
CC  C-methyltransferase that acts on 2-ketoarginine at the 3-position.
**  A similar pathway, TyrB and MppJ, requires PLP and SAM, found in
**  mannopeptimycin biosynthesis, converts phenylalanine to
**  (2S,3S)-beta-methylphenylalanine
