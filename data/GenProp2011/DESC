CC  The 20S proteasome is an intracellular complex of fourteen homologous
CC  proteins known as alpha and beta subunits.  The subunits are arranged
CC  in rings of seven and then stacked.  Each ring contains only alpha or
CC  beta subunits, and these are arranged alpha-beta-beta-alpha in the
CC  stack.  Three of the beta components are N-terminal nucleophile 
CC  hydrolases that are threonine-type endopeptidases, with the N-terminal
CC  threonine being the nucleophile in the reaction.  The active sites are 
CC  directed towards the central cavity, so that a protein threaded through
CC  the central cavity is processed into short peptides.  The three 
CC  catalytically active beta subunits have different specificities, 
CC  known as trypsin-like, chymotrypsin-like and caspase-like [1,2].   
CC  Substrates include intracellular proteins tagged for degradation by 
CC  polyubiquitination and viral proteins.  Peptide products may be 
CC  trafficked to the major histocompatability complex for presentation 
CC  as antigens on T-cells.  Modified versions of the proteasome occur in
CC  immune cells, the thymus and the testis; in these some of the beta or 
CC  alpha subunits are replaced.  Most protein substrates must be 
CC  denatured before being cleaved by the proteasome, and an additional
CC  complex, known as the 19S cap, can be added to either or both ends of
CC  the proteasome.  The 19S cap includes ATPases and a deubiquitinating
CC  enzyme.  This larger complex of the 20S proteasome and 19S cap is 
CC  known as the 26S proteasome [3].
CC  The 20S proteasome is found in all eukaryotes.  In archaea and some
CC  bacteria, a much simpler assembly exists in which each ring is a 
CC  homoheptamer of a single alpha or beta subunit.  
**  Reference [3] is in press.
**  It is not clear if subunits in fungi are numbered differently to that
**  of human.  Panther subfamilies hits differently named subunits.
**  Archaean/bacterial proteasome is GenProp0834
**  Related bacterial HslVU system is GenProp0835.
**  The proteasome is EC 3.4.25.1; this has been incorrectly applied to
**  all 20S proteasome subunits, including the inactive ones.
**  GO:0043161 has been applied to all subunits, even the inactive ones.
**  Evidence for step 1 is also used in GP2014, GP2015 and GP2016.
**  Evidence for step 2 is also used in GP2014, GP2015 and GP2016.
**  Evidence for step 3 is also used in GP2014, GP2015 and GP2016.
**  Evidence for step 4 is also used in GP2014, GP2015 and GP2016.
**  Evidence for step 5 is also used in GP2014, GP2015 and GP2016.
**  Evidence for step 6 is also used in GP2014, GP2015 and GP2016.
**  Evidence for step 7 is also used in GP2014 and GP2015.
**  Evidence for step 8 is also used in GP2014, GP2015 and GP2016.
**  Evidence for step 9 is also used in GP2014, GP2015 and GP2016.
**  Evidence for step 10 is also used in GP2014, GP2015 and GP2016.
**  Evidence in step 12 is also used in GP2016.
**  Evidence in step 13 is also used in GP2016.
**  Evidence in step 14 is also used in GP2016.
**  Threshold is therefore set to 13.
