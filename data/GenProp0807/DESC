CC  This Genome Property is a working space for the guild of bacteriocin
CC  production, focusing on heterocycle-containing in the style of the SagA
CC  system of S. pyogenes. Sets of proteins performing various chemistries
CC  sit nearby, most failing to form cliques among related proteins that
CC  could serve as markers. However, some narrow-scope, high-precision
CC  search models (HMM or BrainGrab) will make strong identifications on
CC  some components. See the article "Discovery of a widely distributed
CC  toxin biosynthetic gene cluster.", PMID: 18375757
