CC  CRISPR repeats are by definition Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short
CC  Palindromic Repeats, described by Jansen [1]. Certain proteins,
CC  including Cas1 to Cas4, are found only in genomes with CRISPR repeats,
CC  and are near these repeats. Jansen, et al. describe CRISPR loci as
CC  having direct repeats, varying in size from 21 to 37 bp, interspaced by
CC  similarly sized non-repetitive sequences. Variants of CRISP/Cas loci
CC  (subtypes) have been described (Haft, et al, PMID:16292354) in which
CC  certain groups of subtype-specific genes are found in addition to
CC  characteristic sets of the more widely distributed cas genes. The Dvulg
CC  subtype, so named because this subtype is the only one found in the
CC  genome of Desulfovibrio vulgaris, also called type I-C, consists of
CC  cas1-5 and the subtype specific genes csd1-2. The repeats associated
CC  with this subtype tend to have a periodicity of 66 nucleotides. This
CC  subtype is found in a wide variety of bacteria and never in the
CC  Archaea. Cas2 in this system has been shown to act as an endonuclease
CC  for dsDNA rather than ssRNA.
