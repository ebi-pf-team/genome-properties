CC  Verrucomicrobium spinosum DSM 4136 and Chthoniobacter flavus Ellin428,
CC  both members of the Verrucomicrobia, have multiple homologous operons
CC  featuring four proteins with similarly narrow species distributions.
CC  Three of these families have N-terminal signal sequences typical of
CC  type IV pilus modification target proteins (see TIGR02523). The fourth
CC  is a large protein, usually > 1300 residues. The majority of these
CC  four-gene cassettes are adjacent to a PEP-CTERM protein (see
CC  TIGR02595), among the largest PEP-CTERM proteins from any species, with
CC  repetitive structure that suggests outer membrane autotransporter
CC  function (see TIGR02601). The surface structures that these cassettes
CC  may from are not yet understood.
**  I think these cassettes need a paper. The autotransporter/PEP-CTERM
**  protein is not included in the property. Proteins renamed Verru_Chthon
**  cassette protein A-D (vccABCD).
