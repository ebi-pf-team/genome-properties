DR  MetaCyc; TRYPDEG-PWY;
CC  Tryptophanase (tryptophan indole-lyase; EC 4.1.99.1) is a catabolic enzyme
CC  that catalyzes the reversible conversion of tryptophan to indole, pyruvate,
CC  and ammonia, in an α,β-elimination reaction. The action of this enzyme
CC  leads to the release of 2-aminoprop-2-enoate, which spontaneously
CC  tautomerizes to form the imine form 2-iminopropanoate, which is
CC  spontaneously hydrolyzed to to pyruvate and ammonia [1, 2].
