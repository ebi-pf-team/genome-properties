DC  Pyruvate fermentation to acetate I
DR  MetaCyc; P142-PWY;
CC  Under anaerobic conditions, pyruvate is still formed by glycolysis, but
CC  since oxidative phosphorylation is not available, pyruvate is fermented to
CC  several end products by different fermentation routes. Acetogens are able
CC  to make up to three molecules of acetate from every molecule of hexose
CC  sugar. Two pyruvate molecules are obtained from the degradation of the
CC  hexose by a glycolytic pathway, and are converted to two acetate molecules.
CC  The conversion of acetyl-CoA to acetate proceeds via the intermediate
CC  acetyl phosphate. The two steps are catalyzed by phosphotransacetylase and
CC  acetate kinase, encoded by the pta and ackA genes, which form an operon
CC  [1,2].
