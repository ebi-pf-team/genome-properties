CC  This Genome Property describes a class of bacteriocin in which
CC  polypeptide produced on a ribosome is circularized. Within this
CC  Property are several non-homologous subgroups, described by different
CC  protein family signatures. Many bacteriocins are described as cyclic,
CC  but this subclass is distinguished by having the N-terminal and
CC  C-terminal amino acids linked from a precursor translated on a
CC  ribosome. They tend to be produced by Gram-positive bacteria, and to
CC  have less post-translational modification than the lantibiotic class of
CC  bacteriocin. Members of this subclass of the circular bacteriocins
CC  include circularin A from Clostridium beijerinckii, bacteriocin AS-48
CC  from Enterococcus faecalis,  uberolysin from Streptococcus uberis, and
CC  carnocyclin A from Carnobacterium maltaromaticum.
