CC  A sigma factor is a DNA-binding protein protein that binds to the
CC  DNA-directed RNA polymerase core to produce the holoenzyme capable of
CC  initiating transcription at specific sites. Different sigma factors act
CC  in vegetative growth, heat shock, extracytoplasmic functions (ECF),
CC  etc. This model represents the clade of sigma factors called sigma-54,
CC  or RpoN (unrelated to sigma 70-type factors such as RpoD/SigA). RpoN is
CC  responsible for enhancer-dependent transcription, and its presence
CC  characteristically is associated with varied panels of activators, most
CC  of which are enhancer-binding proteins (but see Brahmachary, et al.,
CC  PMID:15231786). RpoN may be responsible for transcription of nitrogen
CC  fixation genes, flagellins, pilins, etc., and synonyms for the gene
CC  symbol rpoN, such as ntrA, reflect these observations
