CC  CRISPR repeats are by definition Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short
CC  Palindromic Repeats, described by Jansen [1]. Certain proteins,
CC  including Cas1 to Cas4, are found only in genomes with CRISPR repeats,
CC  and are near these repeats. Jansen, et al. describe CRISPR loci as
CC  having direct repeats, varying in size from 21 to 37 bp, interspaced by
CC  similarly sized non-repetitive sequences. Variants of CRISP/Cas loci
CC  (subtypes) have been described (Haft, Selengut, et al., submitted) in
CC  which certain groups of subtype-specific genes are found in addition to
CC  characteristic sets of the more widely distributed cas genes. The Ypest
CC  subtype, so named because this subtype is the only one found in the
CC  genome of Yersinia pestis, consists of cas1, cas3 and the subtype
CC  specific genes csy1-4. The cas3 gene of this subtype is sufficiently
CC  diverged from the cas3 gene of other CRISPR subtypes that the
CC  construction of a separate HMM was warranted.  The spacers of these
CC  CRISPRs have been analyzed and some have been shown to have been
CC  captured from extrachromosomal sources [2].  The repeats associated
CC  with this subtype tend to have a periodicity of 60 nucleotides. This
CC  subtype is found only in the Proteobacteria.
