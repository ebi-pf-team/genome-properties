CC  Siderophores are chelators for ferric iron, that is, iron(III).
CC  Specific uptake systems for siderophores and their strong avidity for
CC  ferric iron compensate for the low availability of iron in certain
CC  environments. While some siderophores are derived from citrate, citrate
CC  itself chelates iron. Escherichia coli K-12, and some related
CC  enterobacteria, have a dedicated transport system for chelated iron in
CC  the form diferric dicitrate. This system exploits locally available
CC  citrate and obviates the need for siderophore biosynthesis and export.
CC  FecA is both a ferric citrate outer membrane transporter and signaling
CC  molecule that regulates transcription of the ferric citrate update
CC  system. FecBCDE is an ABC transporter complex. It appears that the iron
CC  ion is transported without the chelating citrate. FecR and FecI are
CC  regulatory proteins.
**  Finding IucA/C family proteins nearby will suggest that homologous
**  systems are NOT  ferric citrate transport system.  FOR NOW, it is
**  easier not to include regulatory protein FecI, FecR, which work with
**  FecA, and may be called the same in siderophore-proper systems as well
**  as citrate system.
