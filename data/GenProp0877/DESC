CC  The MotAB complex functions as the stator producing torque in the
CC  mobile flagellar rotor complex. The stator changes conformation in
CC  response to the passage of protons across the cytoplasmic membrane.
CC  This complex is also necessarily a force-generating proton transporter.
CC  The stator complex contains MotA and MotB subunits in a 4:2 ratio and
CC  several stators are associated with each motor, each generating torque
CC  independently.
