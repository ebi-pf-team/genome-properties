CC  Two different pathways for coenzyme M biosynthesis pass through the
CC  intermediate sulfopyruvate. This Genome Property describes a pathway
CC  for the creation of sulfopyruvate via L-cysteate. Cysteate synthase
CC  converts L-phosphoserine to L-cysteate. An aspartate aminotransferase
CC  (not represented explicitly in this Genome Property) can then convert
CC  L-cysteate to sulfopyruvate.
**  The figure shows the same enzyme removing a phosphate, proposed
**  intermediate of dehydroalanine, and adding a sulfate.
