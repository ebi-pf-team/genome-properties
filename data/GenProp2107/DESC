RT  acetate and methanol fermentations by methanosarcina.

DC  Methanogenesis from methanol
DR  MetaCyc; CO2FORM-PWY;
CC  Methane production from methanol was first observed in Methanosarcina [1].
CC  Methanosarcina barkeri is a methanogenic archeon that can grow on acetate
CC  and various one-carbon compounds such as CO2, methylamine, and carbon
CC  monoxide, as well as methanol, as a sole energy source. Growth on methanol
CC  has been reported both in the presence and absence of H2.
