CC  HslVU, also known as ClpQY, is an ATP-dependent protease that resembles
CC  proteasomes. The ATPase HslU acts in protein unfolding, while the
CC  threonine-type endopeptidase HslV is homologous to the proteasome beta
CC  subunit and acts in protein degradation. Members of this family
CC  frequently are described as heat shock proteins.
