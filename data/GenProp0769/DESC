CC  In Neisseria, lipooligosaccharide (LOS) is a highly variable virulence
CC  determinant. This Genome Property describes a set of three
CC  glycosyltransferases (lgtA, lgtB, and lgtE) that work together in the
CC  formation of lacto-N-neotetraose, a component of the LOS alpha chain.
CC  Additional genes may also be present and lead to different types of
CC  LOS.
**  Might want to convert this property to a guild-sufficiency study of
**  Neisseria LOS biosynthesis, or, less broadly, to a generalized lgt
**  locus (LgtA,B,C,D,E, take em or leave em).  Rules exists for LgtC,
**  LgtF, LgtH. Need rules for LgtD, Z at least. Some of these genes have
**  polyG (A,C,D) or polyC  (lgtG) tracts for frameshift variation of the
**  LOS type, and th e literature has a mapping of functional lgt sets to
**  LOS type.
