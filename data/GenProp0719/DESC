CC  Methyl-coenzyme M reductase is a nickel-containing, alpha2/beta2/gamma2
CC  hexameric enzyme that catalyzes the final step in methanogenesis. This
CC  enzyme has several novel post-translational modifications; it is found
CC  in methanogenic archaea, many of which are hyperthermophiles. Many
CC  archaea have two versions of this enzyme. It appears that some Archaea
CC  are methanotrophic; homologous proteins act in the anaerobic oxidation
CC  of methane rather than in methanogenesis.
**  Because of post-translational modifications, define as system and
**  include accessory proteins. Four of the five are a thiopeptide, an
**  S-methylcysteine, a 1-N-methylhistidine and a 5-methylarginine (PMID:
**  11023796)
