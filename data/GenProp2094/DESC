DC  Insulin secretion
DR  KEGG; map04911;
CC  Insulin is secreted by the pancreatic beta cells. Its
CC  secretion can be stimulated by the import of glucose
CC  via a surface transporter, and metabolism of glucose
CC  increases intracellular ATP, inhibiting ATP-sensitive
CC  potassium channels, causing an influx of calcium into
CC  the cell.  Alternatively, there are surface receptors
CC  for peptide hormones such as PACAP [1].  
CC  Binding triggers adenylyl cyclase activation, an 
CC  increase in cAMP, activation of cAMP-dependent second
CC  messengers such as protein kinase A, and secretion of
CC  insulin from vesicles [1].
**  This Genome Property models the release of insulin
**  stored in vesicles induced by peptide hormone GIP.
**  It is difficult to model the pathway initiated by
**  glucose, because it involves the TCA cycle and
**  it is the increase in ATP that triggers Na+/K+ flux
**  and an increase in intracellular Ca2+. 
**  Part of the pathway induced by peptide hormones 
**  requires de novo synthesis of insulin, so is also
**  difficult to model.
