CC  The O5 antigen monomer is a linear tetrasaccharide observed in E. coli
CC  strain 97.0246. It consists of the repeating unit
CC  [->4)-b-D-Gal-(1->3)-a-D-GalNAc-(1->4)-b-D-Qui3NAc-(1->3)-b-D-Rib-(1->]
CC  [1]. Note that the structure reported at ECODAB for O5 actually refers
CC  to a different antigen, that from strain 180/C3 [2], which differs in
CC  the position of the linkage to the D-Qui3NAc sugar, as well as the
CC  reported order of the residues in the monomer unit which are cyclically
CC  permuted (this may result in similar antigenic properties while
CC  resulting from biosynthetic machinery that is relatively less-well
CC  conserved than expected from the overall structural similarity). This
CC  alternate structure from 180/C3, for which there is no sequence data,
CC  is more similar to the structure of the O114(Ec) antigen which is
CC  similarly permuted, and accordingly, the O5 and O114 biosynthetic
CC  clusters have only moderate similarity. Qui3NAc is
CC  3-acetamido-3,6-dideoxy-D-glucose, and is likely made from
CC  4,6-dideoxy-4-oxo-dTDP-D-glucose, the product of the RfbA and RfbB
CC  enzymes found in the cluster. This would then be converted to the
CC  desired product via an aminotransferase and an acetyltransferase, both
CC  also found in the cluster. UDP-GalNAc is made from UDP-GlcNAc by the
CC  product of the gne gene found in the cluster in a similar fashion to
CC  the biosynthesis of the O104 monomer. Ribose and Galactose are both
CC  generally bioavailable. The cluster should require three distinct
CC  glycosyltransferases, but only two genes with known glycosyltransferase
CC  domains are present (the same situation is found in the O114 cluster).
CC  Both O5 and O114 contain homologs of the WbuN and WbuO genes, both of
CC  unknown function. WbuN is a member of the HAD superfamily which is not
CC  known to contain any glycosyltransferases, activities more typically
CC  being restricted to hydrolysis reactions. Note that ECODAB includes an
CC  assignment of the WbuL gene to the third glycosyltransferase reaction,
CC  but that gene has no particular homology support for the assignment,
CC  has no homolog in the O5 cluster, and is positioned among the
CC  D-Qui3NAcyl biosynthetic genes of the O114 cluster, and is more likely
CC  to be the D-Qui3N seryl or D-QuiNSer acetyl-transferase enzyme. If WbuN
CC  or WbuO (or both) are responsible for the third glycosyltransfer
CC  reaction in O5 and O114, it calls into question the reported difference
CC  in the order of the sugars in the monomer since O5 and O114 would have
CC  very distinct linkages as the third activity if this were the case.
