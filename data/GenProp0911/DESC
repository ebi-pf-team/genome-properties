CC  This pathway describes one of two well-desribed pathways for the
CC  conversion of butyryl-CoA to butyrate, a one-step pathway of CoA
CC  transfer to acetate. An alternative two-step pathway transfers butyrate
CC  from CoA to inorganic phosphate, after which a butyrate kinase
CC  transfers the phosphate to ADP. The two pathways can coexist in a
CC  species, and the pathway described here appears to be the more
CC  significant in bacteria of the human colon.
