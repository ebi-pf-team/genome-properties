CC  A complex of TolQ, TolR, and TolA in the inner membrane, interacting
CC  through TolA with a complex of TolB and Pal (also called OprL) present
CC  at the outer membrane, is pivotal to maintaining morphology and outer
CC  membrane integrity in many Gram-negative bacteria. The tol operon(s)
CC  routinely also contain ybgC (orf1) and ybgF (orf2) genes, although
CC  these are not clearly associated with mutant phenotypes. The TolA
CC  protein, homologous to TonB from a similar complex, is the most
CC  divergent, as it consists largely of very low complexity sequence. TolB
CC  contains a variable number of beta-propellar repeats.
**  This system is exploited for uptake of bacteriotoxins (colicins) and
**  filamentous phage DNA (PMID:15701516). The TonB system has some
**  homologous parts, and a species may have both. Previously, PF04055 was
**  in as HMM-CLUST, but it appears this was an artifact of a regular
**  positioning next to preQ0 biosynthesis (e.g. TIGR00364 QueC), and the
**  common neighboring radical SAM may be a QueE, given TIGR03963 is top
**  miss. So, removing the rSAM HMM-CLUST.
