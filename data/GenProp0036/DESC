CC  Biotin is an essential cofactor for many carboxylation (addition of
CC  CO2) reactions. This property reflects biosynthesis of biotin from 
CC  pimeloyl-CoA, although the source of pimeloyl-CoA may vary.
CC  8-amino-7-oxononanoate synthase (also called 7-keto-8-aminopelargonic
CC  acid synthetase, EC 2.3.1.47, from gene BioF) converts pimeloyl-CoA to 
CC  8-amino-7-oxononanoate. Adenosylmethionine-8-amino-7-oxononanoate
CC  aminotransferase (EC 2.6.1.62, gene BioA) converts the product to 
CC  7,8-diaminononanoate, from which dethiobiotin synthase (EC 6.3.3.3, 
CC  gene BioD) makes dethiobiotin. Biotin synthase (EC 2.8.1.6, gene BioB) 
CC  then makes biotin itself. Enzymes such as carboxylesterase (EC 3.1.1.1, 
CC  gene BioH), which are involved in pimeloyl-CoA biosynthesis typically 
CC  receive biotin-related annotations, but may also appear in genomes in 
CC  which biotin is not synthesized and pimeloyl-CoA is used for something 
CC  else.
**  Enzymes involved in the production of pimeloyl-CoA may be designated
**  bio(x) in some species, but pimelate does not necessarily lead to
**  biotin.
