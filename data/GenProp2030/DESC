CC  mTORC1 (mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 or mechanistic 
CC  target of rapamycin complex 1) is a nutrient sensor which  
CC  controls protein synthesis by activating protein translation [1]. 
CC  Protein synthesis requires a supply of amino acids, an energy
CC  source, oxygen abundance and the required growth factors.  When
CC  these conditons are met, Rag GTPase heterodimers are activated, 
CC  interact with Raptor, and mTORC1 is localized to the lysosomal
CC  membrane surface where it can interact with the G protein Rheb
CC  and ATP [2, 3].  The pathway is controlled by two complexes that
CC  interact with the Rag GTPase, GATOR1 (inhibitor) and GATOR2
CC  (activator) [4].
**  mTOR is a serine/threonine kinase that phosphorylates up to
**  800 proteins and is also a component of the mTORC2 complex.
