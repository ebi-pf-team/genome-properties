CC  Iron-sulfur (FeS) cluster assembly systems include the NIF system,
CC  which is part of nitrogen fixation clusters in a number of bacteria, as
CC  well as the ISC and SUF systems. The latter two make FeS clusters for a
CC  wide variety of proteins, while NIF and a related system called
CC  CsdA-CsdE may produce FeS clusters for only a small range of target
CC  proteins. The defining components of the NIF-type systems described
CC  here are the cysteine desulfurase NifS and the FeS cluster assembly
CC  scaffold protein NifU. The terms NifS and NifU are applied not only to
CC  components of nitrogen fixation systems, but also to tandem gene pairs
CC  in other organisms such as Helicobacter pylori. These NifU-like and
CC  NifS-like proteins largely fall into separate clades, and are best
CC  modeled by separate HMMs, but are included in this Genome Property as
CC  components of NIF-type systems. NifS/NifU or NifS-like/NifU-like pairs
CC  may produce FeS clusters for a limited range of target proteins, as in
CC  Azotobacter vinelandii, or uniquely within the cell, as in Helicobacter
CC  pylori.
**  Now I'm growing unhappy.  The NifU and NifS names propagate into
**  several clades, One S-like and one U-like seems to be enough for folks,
**  with some transitivity. But NifS/NifU is targeted nitrogen fixation,
**  the pair in H. pylori is general, others are like their clade-mates,
**  and it is like there are really many two-gene systems.
