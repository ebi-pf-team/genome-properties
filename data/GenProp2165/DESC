CC  The ammonia transporters (Amt proteins) are typically assembled as trimers
CC  of proteins. Plant, bacterial Amt, and yeast MEP familymembers show a
CC  range of concentration dependence for ammonia conductance up to “high 
CC  affinity”, as reflected in their ability to grow on very low 
CC  concentrations of ammonium salts as sole nitrogen source.
