CC  This property represents a 5-step pathway for the biosynthesis of
CC  coenzyme A (CoA) from pantothenate. Most species produce panthothenate
CC  but some must import it. The first step described here is a
CC  sodium/pantothenate symporter. The first required step, catalyzed by
CC  pantothenate kinase, is carried out by at least two different known
CC  protein families. One is found in most bacteria, including E. coli
CC  (TIGR00554). Another is present in eukaryotes and in a few
CC  Gram-positive bacteria (e.g. Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus anthracis)
CC  (TIGR00555). The enzyme, if present, has not been identified in a
CC  number of species. The second and third enzymes are usually found
CC  together in a multifunctional protein, phosphopantothenoylcysteine
CC  decarboxylase/phosphopantothenate--cysteine ligase, once thought to
CC  affect DNA metabolism as well. In Streptococcus and allies, and some
CC  other species, the enzymes are encoded in tandem genes rather than
CC  fused. CoaD and CoaE are, respectively, pantetheine-phosphate
CC  adenylyltransferase and dephospho-CoA kinase [1].
