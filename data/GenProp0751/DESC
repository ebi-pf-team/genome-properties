CC  This property represents the presence of a characteristic gene pair,
CC  found in large paralogous families in several species of Acidobacteria.
CC  One component is a putative transcriptional regulator related to PadR
CC  (TIGR03433). The other is ADOP, or Acidobacterial duplicated orphan
CC  permease (TIGR03434), an integral membrane protein related to ABC
CC  transporter permease components such as LolC, MacB, and FtsX but
CC  orphaned in the sense of not being found next to ATP-binding cassette
CC  (ABC) proteins. The function is unknown.
