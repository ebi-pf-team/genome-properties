CC  CRISPR repeats are by definition Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short
CC  Palindromic Repeats, described by Jansen [1]. Certain proteins,
CC  including Cas1 to Cas4, are found only in genomes with CRISPR repeats,
CC  and are near these repeats. Jansen, et al. describe CRISPR loci as
CC  having direct repeats, varying in size from 21 to 37 bp, interspaced by
CC  similarly sized non-repetitive sequences. Variants of CRISP/Cas loci
CC  (subtypes) have been described (Haft, Selengut, et al., submitted) in
CC  which certain groups of subtype-specific genes are found in addition to
CC  characteristic sets of the more widely distributed cas genes. The Tneap
CC  subtype, so named because this subtype is the only one found in the
CC  genome of Thermotoga neapolitana DSM4359, consists of cas1-5 and the
CC  subtype specific genes cst1-2. The repeats associated with this subtype
CC  tend to have a periodicity of 66 nucleotides. This subtype is found
CC  both in Archaea and Bacteria (with the notable exclusion of the
CC  Proteobacteria).
