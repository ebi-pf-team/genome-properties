RT  A comparison of methanobactins from Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b and
RT  Methylocystis strain Sb2 predicts methanobactins are synthesized from
RT  diverse peptide precursors modified to create a common core for binding
RT  and reducing copper ions.

CC  Methanobactins are siderophore-like copper chelators. The charter
CC  member for this Genome Property is Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b, in
CC  which the methanobactin is made from a 30-residue ribosomally
CC  translated precursor. The only other system known so far is in
CC  Azospirillum sp. B510. Protein families TIGR04039, TIGR04052, and
CC  TIGR04061 contain proteins in which the Methylosinus and Azospirillum
CC  are mutually the best hits among all genomes, suggesting they act in
CC  the methanobactin system.
