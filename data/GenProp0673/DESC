RT  HxlR, a member of the DUF24 protein family, is a DNA-binding protein
RT  that acts as a positive regulator of the formaldehyde-inducible hxlAB
RT  operon in Bacillus subtilis.

CC  The ribulose monophosphate pathway consists of two enzyme,
CC  3-hexulose-6-phosphate synthase (HPS) and 6-phospho-3-hexuloisomerase
CC  (PHI). In one direction, this pathway removes the toxic metabolite
CC  formaldehyde by assimilation. In the other direction, in certain
CC  species lacking the complete pentose phosphate pathway, this pathway
CC  produces consumes fructose 6-phosphate and releases formaldehyde in
CC  order to produce ribulose-5-phosphate, essential for nucleotide
CC  biosynthesis. The two enzymes may occur as a fusion protein, as in
CC  Thermococcus kodakaraensis.
