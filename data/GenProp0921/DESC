CC  This Genome Property represents a pair of radical SAM proteins that
CC  occur as tandem genes in bacteria. The most likely function for this
CC  system is post-translational modification of ribosomally produced
CC  peptides. TIGR03979 describes a family with low levels of sequence
CC  similarity overall, a C-terminal putative peptidoglycan-binding domain,
CC  but also a striking region with five to seven repeats of His-Xaa-Ser.
CC  This family only occurs next to the radical SAM pair. Surprisingly, a
CC  search based on the His-Xaa-Ser repeat region and just a few flanking
CC  amino acids finds that essentially every radical SAM pair has a
CC  His-Xaa-Ser repeats region peptide nearby. TIGR03976 describes an
CC  additional protein in this system, including one branch of the family
CC  with the signature motif LLNDYxLRE.
**  I am getting ready to deprecate claims on TIGR03981, TIGR03982 now that
**  I have extended TIGR03976 (pending) and TIGR03979 and see species with
**  both. In Leptospira, the conserved His-Xaa-Ser cassette includes
**  non-coding regions, and the last coding region is a member of family
**  TIGR04402, a mobilome CxxCx(11)CxxC protein that is often
**  plasmid-borne.
