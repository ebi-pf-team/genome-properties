CC  The maturation enzyme MauG completes the modification and cross-linking
CC  of a pair of Trp residues into the novel cofactor tryptophan
CC  tryptophylquinone, or TTQ, in the light chain (MauA) of methylamine
CC  dehydrogenase. While some analogous enzyme cofactors are produced
CC  autocatalytically from amino acids in the precursor polypeptide, TTQ is
CC  produced with aid of the maturation enzyme MauG. MauG is a di-heme
CC  enzyme with peroxidase activity, similar to di-heme cytochrome c
CC  peroxidases of other biological systems. Interestingly, the pair of
CC  modified Trp residues is conserved in MauA homologs in species that
CC  have no MauG homolog in the vicinity, suggesting no modification,
CC  autocatalytic modification, or a different modification enzyme.
**  Looks like TIGR02659 homologs all have the Tyr-Trp pair that gets
**  modified to become TTG, and has other critical residues as well, and
**  this includes homologs at subfamily rather than equivalog level, yet
**  strangely neighboring to MauG is not conserved except for the top few
**  hits. KEEP EQUIVALOG WITH RESTRICTIVE CUTOFF!  Radical mechanism BUT
**  NOT RADICAL SAM. The MauA light (beta) chain is a genomic marker to
**  help discern MauG from homologs. Good candidate for using FIGfams/the
**  SEED to figure out extent of this subsystem, since cutoffs seem to vary
**  wildly in number of hits.  And what about PF07291 MauE?
