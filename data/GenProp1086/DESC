CC  This Genome Property is a cassette of two tandem radical SAM enzymes of
CC  unknown function, usually accompanied by a MarR family transcriptional
CC  regulator. Species with the system include both members of the genus
CC  Treponema from the human oral microbiome and from the phylum Firmicutes
CC  (class Clostridia) from gut microbiome. Sequence identity for enzymes
CC  spanning this taxonomic divide can exceed 95 percent, certain to
CC  indicate lateral gene transfer. 
**  Viewing in PubSeed showed no additional conserved proteins.
**  Neighborhoods had scant to no evidence of mobility markers. The high
**  identity suggests to me recent, such as resistance systems for
**  human-synthesized antibiotics/antimicrobials (e.g. fluoride?). But
**  using two radical SAM enzymes made me wonder if the system converts a
**  received antibiotic into a different antibiotic to which lineages with
**  the enzymes are insensitive. That would be an interesting phenomenon.
