CC  Ribonucleotide reductases (RNRs) are responsible for the conversion of
CC  the ribose sugar of RNA into the deoxyribose sugar of DNA. This is the
CC  rate-limiting step of DNA biosynthesis. The class I RNRs [1] consist of
CC  two subunits, alpha and beta (also known as the large and small
CC  subunbits, respectively). Class I RNRs generate the required radical
CC  (on tyrosine) via a non-heme iron cofactor which resides in the beta
CC  subunit. The alpha subunit contains the catalytic and allosteric
CC  regulatory sites. The most common gene symbols for these genes are NrdE
CC  (alpha) and NrdF (beta), althought the first characterized complex from
CC  E.coli (NrdAB) turns out to be one of a pair in gammaproteobacteria and
CC  the more divergent one at that. Where multiple class I enzymes exist in
CC  a single organism they are presumed to be under differential
CC  regulation.    Note that earlier reports of a manganese-based class IV
CC  system related to class I in high GC gram positive species was proved
CC  to be spurious [2].    Electrons for this reduction are supplied by
CC  glutaredoxin-like (NrdH, in some species [3]), or flavodoxins specific
CC  to this system which are in turn reduced by oxygen via thioredoxin
CC  reductase.  Detection of this component is not required to set the YES
CC  state because of incomplete knowledge of the various homologs involved.
CC     Certain class I RNRs are associated with a gene of unknown function
CC  (NrdI). NrdI shows up more frequently, but not exclusively in species
CC  with more than one class I RNR, so it may be involved in regulation in
CC  some way.
