CC  The pair of genes making up this property have been proposed to
CC  comprise a cobalt ion imorter for the biosynthesis of vitamin B12
CC  (cobalamin).  Evidence for this assignment includes 1) prediction of
CC  five trans-membrane segments in CbtA and a single additional
CC  trans-membrane segment and a C-terminal histidine-rich motif likely to
CC  be a metal-binding site in CbtB, 2) positional gene linkage with known
CC  B12 biosynthesis genes, 3) upstream proximity of B12 transcriptional
CC  regulatory sites, 4) the absence of other known cobalt import systems
CC  and 5) the obligate co-localization of CbtA and CbtB.
