CC  This rare system consists of a peptide-modifying radical SAM enzyme and
CC  its cysteine-rich targets. In this system, the targets are encoded by
CC  tandem gene pairs. The maturase is similar in sequence, and the targets
CC  in their cysteine richness, to the analogous components of the SCIFF
CC  (Six Cysteines in Forty-Five) system. This system is known so far in
CC  Fibrobacter succinogenes subsp. succinogenes S85 (targets missed in
CC  gene-calling) and in Ruminococcus albus 8.
