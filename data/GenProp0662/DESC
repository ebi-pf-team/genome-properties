CC  This alphaproteobacterial-type photosynthetic reaction center is found
CC  in Rhodobacterales, Rhodospirillales, Rhizobiales. A similar complex is
CC  found in the Chloroflexi, which do not belong to the
CC  alphaproteobacteria. This complex is associated with nonoxygenic
CC  photosynthesis. It differs from photosystems I and II of the
CC  cyanobacteria and plants. The core complex of the reaction center is a
CC  heterotrimer of L, M, and H subunits.
