RT  A novel sortase, SrtC2, from Streptococcus pyogenes anchors a surface
RT  protein containing a QVPTGV motif to the cell wall.

CC  This is a family of sortases and their substrates, less abundant than
CC  the housekeeping sortase, SrtA, and the LPXTG-like target sequences.
CC  SrtB is Listeria monocytogenes appears to process two classes of
CC  signal, NXZTN and NPKXZ (see PMID:16247833). Note that the protein
CC  called SrtB in Streptococcus pyogenes (see PMID:11914350) is a member
CC  of the SrtA family, not the family described here, while the protein
CC  called SrtC2 is a member of the SrtB family (see PMID:15317792).
