CC  Acetate may be generated acetyl phosphate by hydrolysis (3.6.1.7,
CC  acylphosphatase) or by a reversible ATP-dependent reaction (2.7.2.1,
CC  ATP:acetate phosphohydrolase).  The literature also refers to a
CC  reversible pyrophophate-dependent reaction in Entamoeba histolytica
CC  although the sequence of the enzyme responsible is not yet known.
