CC  This property describes a regulon present in E. coli and a number of
CC  other species induced by various stresses including osmotic shock,
CC  ethanol, heat, and expression of various secretins, as occurs with
CC  infection by certain filamentous phage. A common thread to these
CC  stressors may be compromise of the inner membrane and decrease of the
CC  protonmotive force. Most proteins of the regulon occur in a single
CC  operon, but at least one member, pspG, is located elsewhere in most
CC  genomes. The signature genes of the the phage shock regulon are the
CC  sigma-54-dependent positive regulator PspF, PspA which binds to and
CC  inhibits PspF, and PspB and PspC which act together as both regulatory
CC  and effector proteins of the phage shock regulon. PspG occurs in most
CC  but not all phage shock-positive genomes, while PspD and PspE are found
CC  only in a minority of phage shock operons.
**  Probably there is very little generality to the inclusion of PspD and
**  PspE in the regulon across large numbers of species.
