CC  Sublancin is an antibiotic bacterial peptide with a monosaccharide
CC  (glucose) added to a Cys side chain sulfur, in addition to having two
CC  disulfide bonds. This Genome Property represents components of the
CC  system, including the precursor and the S-glycosyltransferase.
**  More than two components, but these are the two key ones. YolF is now
**  immunity protein SunI.
