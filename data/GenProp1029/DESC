CC  This property features a four-gene cassette that appears to be involved
CC  in peptide modification. The system has both a PqqD homolog and two
CC  PqqE homologs. The predicted fifth component, putative modification
CC  target ScmA, is not identified, but Clim_1912 (YP_001943923.1) from
CC  Chlorobium limicola DSM 245 is suggested; homologous ORFs are
CC  demonstrated in the cassettes of the other species with the cassette,
CC  and their alignment modeled by TIGR04252. Three other species with the
CC  cassette are Syntrophobacter fumaroxidans MPOB, Methanocella paludicola
CC  SANAE, and delta proteobacterium NaphS2. Regions homologous to
CC  Clim_1912 are found in the other three species, and conservation at the
CC  amino acid level appears strongest in the reading frame of Clim_1912.
CC  The SPASM domain involvement in peptide modification is described in
CC  PMID:21478363.
**  Also, Clim_1912-like homologs are Cys-rich enough in C-terminal half.
