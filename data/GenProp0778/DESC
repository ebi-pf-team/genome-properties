CC  The GlyGly-CTERM domain, previously called the gammaproteobacterial
CC  enzyme C-terminal transmembrane domain or rhombotail, appears to be a
CC  protein sorting signal analogous to LPXTG and PEP-CTERM. Every genome
CC  that encodes a set of GlyGly-CTERM proteins also encodes a rhomboid
CC  family enzyme, designated rhombosortase, in a many-to-one relationship.
CC  Rhomboid proteases are serine proteases with the active site Ser within
CC  the membrane, and they are capable of cleaving hydrophobic
CC  transmembrane segments. In general, genomes that encode GlyGly-CTERM
CC  proteins and rhombosortase also encode a type 2 secretion system
CC  (T2SS). Several GlyGly-CTERM proteins have been shown to undergo
CC  T2SS-mediated secretion.
