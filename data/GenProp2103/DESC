DC  Pathway: acetoacetate degradation (to acetyl CoA)
DR  MetaCyc; ACETOACETATE-DEG-PWY;
CC  Escherichia coli is able to utilize acetoacetate as a total source of
CC  carbon and energy via the two-step pathway shown here. As end-product, the
CC  pathway has a net yield of one molecule of acetyl-CoA which feeds into
CC  central metabolism via the TCA cycle. Use of acetoacetate as a substrate
CC  increases the levels of these two enzymes 200- to 300-fold [1].
