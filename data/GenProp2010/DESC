CC  Fibrinolysis is the disolving of the blood clot and naturally 
CC  follows coagulation. Plasmin cleaves alpha, beta and gamma chains
CC  of fibrin, thereby releasing the N-terminal peptides where the
CC  isopeptide bonds, which cross-link fibrin fibres, are formed [1].
**  The KEGG pathway makes little sense.  Although the activation of 
**  plasminogen by coagulation factor XIIa might explain how clots are
**  dissolved in the intrinsic blood coagulation pathway, this does not
**  explain how clots are broken down in the extrinsic pathway where
**  factor XII is not activated.  Factor XIa and plasma kallikrein also
**  activate plasminogen, but again both are only active in the 
**  intrinsic pathway.  Although the important roles of the plasminogen 
**  activators uPA and tPA are acknowledged, there is no indication how
**  these are activated.
