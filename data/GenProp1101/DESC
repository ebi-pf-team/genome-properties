CC  This system features a putative carrier protein, TIGR04557, related to
CC  the SoxY and SoxZ carrier complex of the sulfate oxidation cycle, as
CC  well as PQQ-dependent enzymes that have a Cys-Cys motif, and
CC  specialized cytochromes involved in electron transport. Authentic SoxY
CC  (see TIGR04488) is a carrier protein for sulfur oxidation, with a
CC  covalent attachment site near its C-terminus, a Cys residue in the
CC  context GGCGG or GGCG. The  carrier Cys of SoxY is conserved in
CC  TIGR04557, but what might be attached in the latter is unknown. Note
CC  that GenProp0895 (alcohol ABC transporter, PedABC-type) describes a
CC  four-gene operon closely tied to this system.
**  Some of this, mostly the fusion, may be new discovery. Property should
**  require PQQ biosynthesis (but that would make TIGR03075 count twice!).
**  TIGR03871 needs annotation help. Some of the additional correlated
**  proteins are subfamilies with multiple equivalogs, none universal and
**  often several paralogs per genome. Beware.
