CC  This two-gene peroxiredoxin consists of ahpC and ahpF, ususally as
CC  tandem genes in an apparent operon. Peroxiredoxin detoxifies alkyl
CC  hydroperoxides by catalyzing the oxidation of an active site cysteine
CC  (on AhpC) to a sulfenic acid. This subsequently becomes a disulfide
CC  which is then resolved by reduction. AhpF contains an FAD-binding
CC  domain along with a NAD(P)H binding domain (PF07992).
