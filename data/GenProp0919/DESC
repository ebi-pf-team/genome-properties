CC  This property describes a radical SAM protein and its 45-amino acid
CC  partner with six conserved Cysteine residues. The system appears to be
CC  universal in the Clostridia, and rare outside the Clostridia. This
CC  pattern suggests a house-keeping role rather than a role such as
CC  bacteriocin production. Meanwhile, among all characterized radical SAM
CC  proteins, those closest by homology to the member of this system are
CC  modification enzymes for short peptides.
**  Wrote to Doug Mitchell to suggest he characterize this one.
