CC  This property represents a membrane-associated three-protein enzyme
CC  complex. The enzyme, designated methane monooxygenase shows a broad
CC  specificiy for methane (to methanol), ammonia (to hydroxylamine), and
CC  various alkanes and alkenes. However, this enzyme is commonly named
CC  according to its relavant biological role in species in which it
CC  occurs: methane monooxygenase in methanotrophs, ammonia monooxygenase
CC  in nitrifiers.
