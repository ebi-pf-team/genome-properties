CC  This property represents the presence of three-subunit transporters
CC  related to the DctPQM system for dicarboxylate transport in Rhodobacter
CC  capsulatus. These are secondary transporters, energized by ion
CC  gradients, rather than primary transporters powered by ATP directly [1].
CC  The acronym TRAP, or TRAP-T, stands for Tripartite ATP-independent
CC  Periplasmic Transporters. The characteristic architecture includes an
CC  integral membrane protein with 12 predicted transmembrane (TM) regions
CC  (e.g.DctM) and another with 4 predicted TM regions (e.g. DctQ). These
CC  two are fused in some species [2]. Also present is an extracytoplasmic
CC  solute receptor (ESR). In addition to C4 dicarboxylates, substrates 
CC  moved by related transporters appear to include mannitol, aspartate 
CC  derivative ectoine, and other as yet uncharacterized solutes. Some 
CC  bacteria, such as Bradyrhizobium japonicum, may contain over a dozen 
CC  such transporters.
