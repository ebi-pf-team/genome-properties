CC  Pupylation is the process by which the small protein Pup is conjugated
CC  to proteins through its C-terminus to a lysine epsilon-amino group of
CC  the target. This modification, analogous to ubiquitination in
CC  eukaryotes, targets proteins for degradation by archaeal-type
CC  proteasomes in Mycobacterium tuberculosis and related Actinobacteria.
**  Add Aravind paper on pupylation. Note that the Actinobacterial
**  proteasome subunits are not yet a property - that system should be
**  built and include this system. This system IS sporadically distributed
**  OUTSIDE Actinobacteria, yet we have no examples in house.
