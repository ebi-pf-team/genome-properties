Representative Species
======================


Genome Properties results are calculated for a representative set of species for each release. This data is available within the viewer, either by browsing the taxonomic tree, or by searching for a particular species name or taxonomic ID.

The list of species currently included in this set can be found within the GitHub repository, here:
